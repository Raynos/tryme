## make your own

A tryme is simply a readme with the javascript code sections given special cow powers! If you want to make a javascript code block special, just add a `// =>` at the end.

The tryme.jit.su web service will load any github repo and let users play around with your README and code examples.

## cli

You can use tryme locally for testing, debug, and play before publishing your work.

```
npm install -g tryme
tryme /path/to/project
```

Tryme server is now running and you can open a browser to play around with your README or other example files.
